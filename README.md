# WeatherApp

Welcome to WeatherApp, a simple and user-friendly application designed to provide real-time weather updates. This app was developed during my internship at Bharat Intern, using the robust and modern Kotlin language.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Get the latest weather information for your current location or any city around the world.

- **Location Permissions**: The app requires location permissions to provide accurate weather data. On the first launch, you will be prompted to grant either precise or coarse location permissions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is easy to navigate with a clean and minimal design, making it simple for users of all ages and tech-savviness levels.

## How to Use

1. **Install the App**: Download the WeatherApp from the Play Store and install it on your device.

2. **Grant Permissions**: Upon first opening the app, you will be prompted to grant location permissions. You can choose to provide either precise or coarse location.

3. **View Weather Details**: Once permissions are granted, the app will display the current weather details for your location.
